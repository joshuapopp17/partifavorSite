        <h4>Planning parties in a group chat is a hassle. One day you don't check your phone
            and the party is in a whole different location and time. For this reason we created
            Partifavor. Partifavor allows a user to host a party and add "partifavors" which
            others can then bring. This solves the issue of potlucks where everyone only brings
            chips or plates. With real time updates everyone will be aware of what is happening. 
            Skip the groupchat, use partifavor.
